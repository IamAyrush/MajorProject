Thrilled to unveil my latest project, 
 "The Bars Only"! 
Inspired by a game that I saw at Connaught Place when I was roaming around with my friends 🤧,
I transformed the concept into a virtual game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 🚀 Dive into a realm where your reaction time takes center stage, engaging both your eyes and brain in a symphony of coordination. 🧠👀 It's more than just a game; it's a test of your body's reflexes, showcasing the seamless interplay between human senses. 🕹️ Elevate your cognitive agility with this immersive experience! Ready to challenge yourself? 💪
